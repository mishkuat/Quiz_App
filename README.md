# Getting Started with Create React App




### Frontend Setup (React App)

1. Navigate to the src directory:
   ```bash
   cd src
    ```
     2. Install React dependencies:
   Ensure that you have **Node.js** installed on your system. Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the React app:
   After installing all dependencies, you can start the React application with the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   This will launch the React development server.
